A simple starter template for a **Vue3** + **Electron** TypeScript based application, including **ViteJS** and **Electron Forge**.
</div>

## About

This template utilizes [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev) for building and serving your (Vue powered) front-end process, it provides Hot Reloads (HMR) to make development fast and easy ⚡ 

Building and packaging the Electron (main) process is done with [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/), which makes your application easily distributable and supports cross-platform compilation 😎

## Getting started

Click the green **Use this template** button on top of the repository, and clone your own newly created repository.

**Or..**

Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:Deluze/electron-vue-template.git`


### Install dependencies ⏬

```bash
npm install
```

### Start developing ⚒️

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Additional Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # starts application with hot reload
npm run build    # builds main & renderer into the "build" folder
npm run make     # builds distributable installers via Electron Forge
npm run package  # packages the app without creating installers
```
For more details about packaging, see the [Electron Forge docs](https://www.electronforge.io/).
## Project Structure

```bash
- scripts/ # all the scripts used to build or serve your application, change as you like.
- src/
  - main/ # Main thread (Electron application source)
  - renderer/ # Renderer thread (VueJS application source)
```

## Using static files

If you have any files that you want to copy over to the app directory after installation, you will need to add those files in your `src/main/static` directory.

Files in said directory are only accessible to the `main` process, similar to `src/renderer/assets` only being accessible to the `renderer` process. Besides that, the concept is the same as to what you're used to in your other front-end projects.

#### Referencing static files from your main process

```ts
/* Assumes src/main/static/myFile.txt exists */

import {app} from 'electron';
import {join} from 'path';
import {readFileSync} from 'fs';

const path = join(app.getAppPath(), 'static', 'myFile.txt');
const buffer = readFileSync(path);
```
